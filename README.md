# Style Tiles in HTML, CSS og js - starting point

This is meant as a starting point for an online style Tile.  

You are strongly encouraged to fork this and edit anything you like to make it your own.

Originally forked from https://github.com/jeradg/style-tiles-with-scss, but a lot has been rewritten. (see this for the SCSS version)

Major changes:
This is a somewhat simplified version in plain CSS (and stripped for SCSS). Some files and styling have been deleted.

# Some relevant content from the orginal readme file (the SCSS version)

### What's this, then?
Design style tiles with ~~S~~CSS! Unchain your design ideas from Photoshop and jump straight into code. Upload to your server and share tiles with clients. It's responsive, too. 

#### Originally designed for and in CodePen
Fork this in CodePen and make your own tiles: http://codepen.io/jeradg/pen/rFqat. Share your tiles with clients with the Full Page link. Go
